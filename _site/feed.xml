&lt;p&gt;Next up in my Canadian Postcards series: Calgary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calgary Tower, the Saddledome and the Bow Building are surrounded by the Bow River and backed by the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/saddledome-close-up.png&quot; alt=&quot;Saddledome Closeup&quot; /&gt;
The convex oval roof of the Saddledome was tough to do. The upside-down construction and mudguards give it its shape. It’s set into the base using a Technic pin, which also allows it to sit on a slight angle, helping the top to appear a bit more oval-y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the instructions available for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-98102/NicePartsUsage/calgary-skyline-postcard/#details&quot;&gt;Rebrickable&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a version without the Alberta flag and Calgary/Cal-Gary/Cal-gree stickers/tiles as I can’t add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Alberta flag tile from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign&quot;&gt;Million Prints Design&lt;/a&gt; who also takes custom orders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mocs" /><category term="architecture" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Toronto Skyline Postcard</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/01/toronto-skyline-postcard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Toronto Skyline Postcard" /><published>2022-01-01T18:36:37-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-01T18:36:37-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/01/toronto-skyline-postcard</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/01/toronto-skyline-postcard.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/toronto-skyline-postcard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Toronto Skyline Postcard&quot; /&gt;
While the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/&quot;&gt;delayed or cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, I built a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics of the official sets, I think I’ve made mine in the same dimensions as Lego’s. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cn-tower-close-up.png&quot; alt=&quot;CN Tower Closeup&quot; /&gt;
There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
