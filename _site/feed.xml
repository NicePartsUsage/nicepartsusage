Although the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/&quot;&gt;delayed or cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, I made a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics, I think I’ve made mine in the same dimensions as the official Lego sets. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I submitted free instructions to Rebrickable (waiting on approval), though it’s a version without the Toronto/Turonno stickers/tiles and Canadian flag as I’m not sure how to add custom parts in Rebrickable. They would need to be made custom and I plan on ordering some soon. The Canadian flag piece is custom printed but that you can actually buy from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign&quot;&gt;Million Print Design&lt;/a&gt;. I am not affiliated in any way, just a fan of his stuff and a supporter of Canadian businesses :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mocs" /><category term="architecture" /><summary type="html">Although the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been delayed or cancelled, I made a version of Toronto featuring its skyline.
