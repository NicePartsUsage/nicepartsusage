&lt;p&gt;#3 in my Canadian Postcard series: Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montreal had many amazing buildings to choose from. This model features the Notre-Dame Basilica, Marché Bonsecours, Montreal Stock Exchange, the 1000, Place Ville Marie, and the tiniest representation of Oratoire St-Joseph in the mountain (Mount Royal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of arched windows and openings in the Notre-Dame Basilica, tough shapes to pull off on a very small scale. The liberal use of 1 x 1 with tooth plates stuck in bricks with Technic holes gives it a lot of its form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printed bricks from the Lego Architecture San Francisco set were perfect for Place Ville Marie, but I had to use sideways construction to get the right scale. The buildings are held in place with brackets. Not very secure, but considering the overall size of the model and that it’s meant for display not play, stability isn’t a huge issue. The 1000 building uses printed pieces of Hermione’s skirt, and also uses sideways construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the instructions available for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-98529/NicePartsUsage/montreal-skyline-postcard/#details&quot;&gt;Rebrickable&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a version without the Quebec flag and Montreal/Montréal stickers/tiles as I can’t add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Quebec flag tile from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign&quot;&gt;Million Prints Design&lt;/a&gt; who also takes custom orders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="mocs" /><category term="architecture" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Calgary Skyline Postcard</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/13/calgary-skyline-postcard.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Calgary Skyline Postcard" /><published>2022-01-13T17:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-13T17:30:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/13/calgary-skyline-postcard</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mocs/architecture/2022/01/13/calgary-skyline-postcard.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/calgary-skyline-postcard.png&quot; alt=&quot;Calgary Skyline Postcard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up in my Canadian Postcards series: Calgary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calgary Tower, the Saddledome and the Bow Building are surrounded by the Bow River and backed by the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/saddledome-close-up.png&quot; alt=&quot;Saddledome Closeup&quot; /&gt;
The convex oval roof of the Saddledome was tough to do. The upside-down construction and mudguards give it its shape. It’s set into the base using a Technic pin, which also allows it to sit on a slight angle, helping the top to appear a bit more oval-y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made the instructions available for free on &lt;a href=&quot;https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-98102/NicePartsUsage/calgary-skyline-postcard/#details&quot;&gt;Rebrickable&lt;/a&gt;.

While the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/&quot;&gt;delayed or cancelled&lt;/a&gt;, I built a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics of the official sets, I think I’ve made mine in the same dimensions as Lego’s. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cn-tower-close-up.png&quot; alt=&quot;CN Tower Closeup&quot; /&gt;
There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.&lt;/p&gt;
