While the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/">delayed or cancelled</a>, I built a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics of the official sets, I think I’ve made mine in the same dimensions as Lego’s. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.</p>

There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.</p>

<p>I’ve made the instructions available for free on <a href="https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-96882/NicePartsUsage/toronto-skyline-postcard/#details">Rebrickable</a>. It’s a version without the Canadian flag and Toronto/Turonno stickers/tiles as I can’t add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Canadian flag tile from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign">Million Prints Design</a> who also takes custom orders. I am not affiliated in any way, just a fan of his stuff and a supporter of Canadian businesses :)</p>
