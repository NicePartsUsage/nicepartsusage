Although the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/">delayed or cancelled</a>, I made a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics, I think I’ve made mine in the same dimensions as the official Lego sets. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.</p>

There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.</p>

<p>I submitted free instructions to Rebrickable (waiting on approval), though it’s a version without the Toronto/Turonno stickers/tiles and Canadian flag as I’m not sure how to add custom parts in Rebrickable. They would need to be made custom and I plan on ordering some soon. The Canadian flag piece is custom printed but that you can actually buy from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign">Million Prints Design</a>. I am not affiliated in any way, just a fan of his stuff and a supporter of Canadian businesses :)</p>
