#3 in my Canadian Postcard series: Montreal.

Montreal had many amazing buildings to choose from. This model features the Notre-Dame Basilica, Marché Bonsecours, Montreal Stock Exchange, the 1000, Place Ville Marie, and the tiniest representation of Oratoire St-Joseph in the mountain (Mount Royal).

There are lots of arched windows and openings in the Notre-Dame Basilica, tough shapes to pull off on a very small scale. The liberal use of 1 x 1 with tooth plates stuck in bricks with Technic holes gives it a lot of its form.

The printed bricks from the Lego Architecture San Francisco set were perfect for Place Ville Marie, but I had to use sideways construction to get the right scale. The buildings are held in place with brackets. Not very secure, but considering the overall size of the model and that it's meant for display not play, stability isn't a huge issue. The 1000 building uses printed pieces of Hermione's skirt, and also uses sideways construction.

I'll be making the instructions available for free on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/users/NicePartsUsage/profile/). It'll be a version without the Quebec flag and Montreal/Montréal stickers/tiles as I can't add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Quebec flag tile from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign) who also takes custom orders.
