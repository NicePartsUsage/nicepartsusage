Although the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been [delayed or cancelled](https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/), I made a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics, I think I've made mine in the same dimensions as the official Lego sets. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.

There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.

I submitted free instructions to Rebrickable (waiting on approval), though it's a version without the Toronto/Turonno stickers/tiles and Canadian flag as I'm not sure how to add custom parts in Rebrickable. They would need to be made custom and I plan on ordering some soon. The Canadian flag piece is custom printed but that you can actually buy from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign). I am not affiliated in any way, just a fan of his stuff and a supporter of Canadian businesses :)
