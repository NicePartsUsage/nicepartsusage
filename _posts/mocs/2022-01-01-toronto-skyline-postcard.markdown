While the Lego Creator Postcard sets originally planned for release today have been [delayed or cancelled](https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/2022-lego-marvel-mech-and-creator-cards-are-likely-delayed-cancelled/), I built a version of Toronto featuring its skyline. Based on the preview pics of the official sets, I think I've made mine in the same dimensions as Lego's. Of course, who knows what might get changed before they do launch their sets.

There is some nice parts usage in the CN Tower. The white part is a Ninjago mask. Combined with the other elements, including a candle, it gives a decent impression of the landmark.

I submitted free instructions to Rebrickable (waiting on approval), though it's a version without the Canadian flag and Toronto/Turonno stickers/tiles as I can't add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Canadian flag tile from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign) who also takes custom orders. I am not affiliated in any way, just a fan of his stuff and a supporter of Canadian businesses :)
