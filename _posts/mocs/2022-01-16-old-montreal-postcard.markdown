#3 in my Canadian Postcard series: Montreal.

Montreal had many amazing buildings to choose from but I went with some classics: Notre-Dame, Oratoire St-Joseph, and Marché Bonsecours. Mont-Royal in the background completes this model and adds some nice colour to it.

There are lots of arched windows and openings in the buildings in the foreground, tough shapes to pull off on a very small scale. The liberal use of 1 x 1 with tooth plates stuck in bricks with Technic holes give these buildings a lot of their form.


I've made the instructions available for free on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-98102/NicePartsUsage/old-montreal-postcard/#details). It's a version without the Quebec flag and Montreal/Montréal stickers/tiles as I can't add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Quebec flag tile from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign) who also takes custom orders.
