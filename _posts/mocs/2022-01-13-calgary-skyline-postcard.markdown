![Calgary Skyline Postcard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/calgary-skyline-postcard.png)

Next up in my Canadian Postcards series: Calgary!

Calgary Tower, the Saddledome and the Bow Building are surrounded by the Bow River and backed by the Rockies.

![Saddledome Closeup]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/saddledome-close-up.png)
The convex oval roof of the Saddledome was tough to do. The upside-down construction and mudguards give it its shape. It's set into the base using a Technic pin, which also allows it to sit on a slight angle, helping the top to appear a bit more oval-y.

I've made the instructions available for free on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-96882/NicePartsUsage/calgary-skyline-postcard/#details). It's a version without the Alberta flag and Calgary/Cal-Gary/Cal-gree stickers/tiles as I can't add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the Alberta flag tile from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign) who also takes custom orders.
