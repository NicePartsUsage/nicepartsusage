Three electric light bricks bring this postcard of the Vancouver skyline to life. Some funky angles help hide the light bricks.

Featuring: Vancouver House, Living Shangri-La, Vancouver Lookout, Science World (with the tiniest hint of the end of False Creek), a yellow cab + an orange Vancouver Taxi.

In the background with Vancouver Harbour: Marine Building, Canada Place

I've made the instructions available for free on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-99681/NicePartsUsage/vancouver-skyline-postcard/#details). It's a version without the BC flag and Vancouver/Raincouver stickers/tiles as I can't add custom parts in Rebrickable. You can buy the BC flag tile from [Million Prints Design](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/MillionPrintsDesign) who also takes custom orders.
